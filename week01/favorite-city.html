    <title>My Favorite City - Arequipa, Peru</title>

    <h1>Arequipa: La Ciudad Blanca</h1>

    <p>
        My favorite city is Arequipa, Peru, often called "The White City" because of its beautiful colonial
        buildings constructed from sillar, a white volcanic stone. The city is set dramatically against three towering
        volcanoes, including the iconic El Misti.

        I absolutely love Arequipa because it is so beautiful, peaceful, and the food is amazing! Wandering
        through the historic center, from the Plaza de Armas to the colorful Santa Catalina Monastery, is a wonderfully
        serene experience, and the local cuisine (like Rocoto Relleno) is unmatched.
